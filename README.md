# Tabular browser

A generic browser for DB tables and inserting data in those tables. This is a front end for https://github.com/arvindkhadri/tabular-backend.

The application has been deployed at https://tabular-browser.herokuapp.com/.

The app has two views viz `data loader` and `data viewer`. `data viewer` allows one to see the tables that are connected to a predefined backend.
In the `data loader` view one can insert data into the table.
